<SectionLabel>The uncomfortable truth</SectionLabel>

## It's never the components

I've watched three design systems die slow, painful deaths. Not because the components were poorly built — they were fine. Beautiful, even. Documented to within an inch of their lives. The tokens were immaculate. The Figma library was chef's kiss.

They failed because **nobody wanted to use them**.

Or more accurately: nobody was *incentivised* to use them, nobody was *accountable* for adoption, and the team that built the system had no authority to enforce consistency.

<KeyInsight title="Core tension">
A design system is an organisational tool disguised as a technical tool. If you treat it as purely a tech problem, you'll build something beautiful that nobody uses.
</KeyInsight>

## The three ways systems die

### 1. The ivory tower

A dedicated design systems team builds in isolation for six months. They emerge with a pristine library. Meanwhile, product teams have shipped three redesigns using their own components. The gap between the system and reality is too wide to bridge.

### 2. Death by committee

Every team has input. Every edge case gets a meeting. The system tries to serve everyone and ends up serving no one. Components become so flexible they're meaningless. Configuration props multiply like rabbits.

### 3. The abandoned pet

Someone builds it as a passion project. It's brilliant. They get promoted or leave. Nobody picks it up. The system slowly rots as the product evolves around it.

<Callout>
If you're nodding along, you've probably lived through at least one of these. The good news: they're all fixable. The bad news: the fixes are organisational, not technical.
</Callout>

## What actually works

After watching these failures (and contributing to a few), I've landed on a handful of things that genuinely move the needle:

- **Embed, don't hand off.** Design systems people should sit *inside* product teams part-time, not throw components over the wall.
- **Measure adoption, not coverage.** It doesn't matter if you have 200 components. It matters if teams are using them. Track adoption rate ruthlessly.
- **Start with what's already shipped.** Don't design the ideal system. Codify what exists. Make the common path easier, and teams will follow.
- **Give teams a voice but not a veto.** Contribution models matter. Let teams propose components, but have a small group with decision-making authority.

## It's a people problem

The hardest skill in design systems work isn't component API design or token architecture. It's **navigating organisational politics**. It's convincing a VP that consistency matters. It's helping a senior engineer understand why their custom date picker should use the shared one. It's sitting in a room where people disagree and finding the path forward.

That's the work. That's what makes or breaks a system at scale.

<KeyInsight title="My take">
The best design systems team I ever worked with spent 40% of their time on components and 60% on relationships, documentation, and enablement. That ratio felt right.

If you're building a design system right now and feeling stuck, I'd love to hear about it. Sometimes a fresh set of eyes on the organisational dynamics is more valuable than another audit of your component library.
