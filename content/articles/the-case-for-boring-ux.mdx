## Nobody tweets about good UX

You know what makes a great door handle? You don't think about it. You reach out, grab, pull or push — and it works. No instructions needed. No delight. No "wow moment." Just a door that opens.

**That's good UX.**

The best interfaces are the same. They don't win awards. They don't get screenshot threads on Twitter. They don't make designers feel clever. They just *work*, and users get on with their lives.

<KeyInsight title="The paradox">
The better your UX is, the less anyone notices it. The goal is invisibility.
</KeyInsight>

## The delight trap

Somewhere along the way, our industry got obsessed with "delight." Every interaction needs a microanimation. Every empty state needs a cute illustration and a witty message. Every loading state needs to be a branded experience.

Don't get me wrong — delight has its place. This portfolio has an entire bad-UX mode built for fun. I love playful design.

But when delight becomes the *goal* rather than a *bonus*, you end up optimising for the wrong thing. You end up with:

- Animations that slow down power users
- Clever microcopy that confuses non-native speakers
- Onboarding flows that prioritise personality over clarity
- Empty states so delightful that nobody bothers to fill them

<Callout>
Delight is dessert. Don't serve it before the main course is sorted.

## What boring actually means

When I say "boring UX," I mean:

- **Predictable.** The user can guess what happens before they do it.
- **Consistent.** The same pattern works the same way everywhere.
- **Fast.** No unnecessary steps, animations, or detours.
- **Clear.** Labels say what they mean. Buttons do what they say.
- **Forgiving.** Mistakes are easy to undo. Destructive actions get a confirmation.

That's not lazy design. That's *disciplined* design. It takes tremendous restraint to solve a problem with a text label when you could build a custom tooltip with an animated mascot.

<SectionLabel>Where it matters most</SectionLabel>

## The high-stakes test

Boring UX matters most in high-stakes moments. When someone is:

- Transferring money
- Submitting a medical form
- Cancelling a subscription
- Reporting a safety issue

In these moments, clarity isn't just nice — it's ethical. A user shouldn't need to wonder if they clicked the right button when their health data is on the line.

<KeyInsight title="My rule of thumb">
The higher the stakes, the more boring the UX should be. Save the personality for low-stakes, low-frequency moments.
</KeyInsight>

## The craft is in the constraint

There's a misconception that boring UX means boring *work*. It doesn't. Designing a system that's predictable, consistent, fast, clear, and forgiving across hundreds of screens is some of the hardest design work there is.

It means:

- Building a token system that scales (hi, design systems nerds)
- Writing content guidelines that hold up across every edge case
- Testing with real users who don't share your mental model
- Saying "no" to features that are fun but unnecessary
- Maintaining quality at scale when the org wants to move fast

That's the work. It's not glamorous. It doesn't make for a great Dribbble shot. But it's the work that makes products people *trust*.

Next time someone calls your design "boring," say thank you. You've done your job.
